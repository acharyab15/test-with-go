## What is a test?

> A test is a repeatable process that verifies whether or not something is working as intended.

## Why do tests matter?

1. Tests help find, fix, and prevent mistakes (bug, side effects, edge cases, etc)
2. Tests document expected behavior
3. Tests encourage us to write better code -- break down into smaller units
4. Tests can speed up development -- confidence, new developers, changes to code etc
